# FleetToolsv2
# DEPRECATED
~~Updated R Shiny app for a fleet tool system for AirlineClub and MyFlyClub~~

## New Version:
After a good year of service, I've decided that it is time for this project to move on from RShiny.
I love RShiny and think it is a great framework, but I've decided to move this application into a Flask application.
This decision was made to keep up with a more popular and updated framework and to allow greater flexibility in what the application can do.

The repo for the new version is here: https://github.com/bertauchekurtis/flaskFleetTools

You can access the live version of the new application at https://fleetreport.xyz
